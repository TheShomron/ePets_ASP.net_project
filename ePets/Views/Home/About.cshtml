    TOGETHER, WE CAN SAVE ANIMALS <br />
    We’re working to protect animals currently threatened with extinction.
</h4>


<h6 class="AnimalBox">
    Originally established in 2015, Save Animals Facing Extinction was created to support Initiative 1401, a first-of-its-kind ballot measure in Washington State which prohibited the purchase, sale, and distribution of products made from a list of 10 endangered animals.  Working closely with partners from the nation’s leading conservation, education, and zoological organizations,
    as well as grassroots donors from across the United States, I-1401 passed with over 70 percent support in November 2015.<br />

In 2016, Save Animals Facing Extinction was relaunched as a 501(c)(4) social welfare, not-for-profit organization that supports policies nationwide at the state and federal levels
that will protect Earth’s most precious wildlife.  The best way to protect our planet’s endangered wildlife is to ensure that strong laws are in place and that severe penalties are
levied against the criminals who deal in wildlife trafficking.  Humans are the reason that so many of our most iconic and important wildlife are struggling to survive, and together,
humans can work to save them.<br />

Despite our successes, opponents continue to block similar attempts across the country. The gun lobby and ivory dealers have killed 
common-sense legislation in Congress and in dozens of states which would have protected endangered wildlife. We need to fight back, and overcome the obstruction
by those who wish to profit from the market of wildlife products.<br />

The race against extinction is urgent and immediate, and the campaign to protect these endangered and exploited species needs your financial support and commitment.
Your support allows us to make an impact in saving endangered animals.  Funds raised will be used to support ballot measures, lobbying efforts,
and other advocacy activities in support of laws protecting endangered species.<br />

Together, we can make a real difference in saving animals facing the threat of extinction.
